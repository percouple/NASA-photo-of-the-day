# NASA APOD

## Side Effects Module Project

This will be a two-module project. In it, you will consume the NASA API to fetch the "Astronomy Photo Of The Day" or APOD. Once you fetch the data, you will build a few components that will render different pieces of data in your interface.

In the second module (in the [README_DAY_TWO](./README_DAY_TWO.md) file), you will re-style your app using Styled Components.

## Introduction

In this project, you will build an application to show the NASA photo of the day. You will start from scratch and build the entire app. You don't have any design specs to follow for this project, so start by building a basic wireframe first. Make the wireframe simple initially since you don't know what data you'll get back from NASA. 

When you do get the data back, there may be more or less than you expected, so your design plans may change. That's totally fine and very normal in the real world. Just make the proper adjustments and move forward! 

This is a really fun project, and one to show your family and friends when you've finished. Have some fun with it!
